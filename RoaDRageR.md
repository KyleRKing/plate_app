2. create a **markdown** (readme.md) with your **Wireframes** and **User Stories** in preparation for a presentation on Monday morning. Create a **new github repo** and push the markdown to github. If you need extra help on how to make a markdown you can follow this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_18/blob/master/projects/project-1/markdown.md) in the class repo
